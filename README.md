## About the game
----------------------
### Archetype
This game is based on **Endless Space 2**. **Endless Space 2** is a turn-based strategy, science fiction 4X game developed by Amplitude Studios. At the beginning of the game, the player can choose from one of several races, each with their own perks and traits. They are then given control of a fledgling empire, which they must expand by conquering systems. Each system has up to 5 planets, with their own environments, climates, stats (i.e. production, food, etc.), and sometimes anomalies. Anomalies can be explored using an explorer ship, and give buffs or debuffs to the entire system. Planet stats decide how effective planets are at what, while environments decide whether a planet is colonizable or not. The ability to colonize different environments is unlocked through research. Each planet can also be given a specialization, which give buffs, with additional buffs being granted based on climate.
